##  Data Science Projects [Tasks]

### Level 1

#### Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing

**Objective:**  
Explore the dataset to understand its structure and handle any data quality issues.

**Tasks:**
- Identify the number of rows and columns in the dataset.
- Check for missing values in each column and handle them appropriately.
- Perform data type conversion if necessary.
- Analyze the distribution of the target variable ("Aggregate rating") and identify any class imbalances.

**Description:**  
In this task, the dataset is examined to gain an initial understanding of its structure and contents. The focus is on identifying missing values and handling them to ensure data integrity. Data type conversions are performed where necessary to facilitate further analysis. The distribution of the target variable is analyzed to check for any class imbalances that might affect model performance.

#### Task 2: Descriptive Analysis

**Objective:**  
Conduct descriptive statistical analysis to gain insights into the data.

**Tasks:**
- Calculate basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.
- Explore the distribution of categorical variables such as "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines."
- Identify the top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.

**Description:**  
This task involves calculating key statistical measures to summarize the data. The distribution of categorical variables is explored to identify patterns and trends. Additionally, the most popular cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants are identified, providing insights into dining trends.

#### Task 3: Geospatial Analysis

**Objective:**  
Visualize and analyze the geographical distribution of restaurants.

**Tasks:**
- Visualize the locations of restaurants on a map using latitude and longitude information.
- Analyze the distribution of restaurants across different cities or countries.
- Determine if there is any correlation between the restaurant's location and its rating.

**Description:**  
Geospatial analysis is performed to visualize the locations of restaurants and analyze their distribution across various regions. The relationship between the restaurant's location and its rating is examined to see if geographic factors influence customer ratings.

### Level 2

#### Task 1: Table Booking and Online Delivery

**Objective:**  
Analyze the impact of table booking and online delivery options on restaurant ratings.

**Tasks:**
- Determine the percentage of restaurants that offer table booking and online delivery.
- Compare the average ratings of restaurants with table booking versus those without.
- Analyze the availability of online delivery among restaurants with different price ranges.

**Description:**  
This task focuses on examining the availability and impact of table booking and online delivery services. The percentage of restaurants offering these services is determined, and their effect on average ratings is analyzed. Additionally, the relationship between online delivery availability and restaurant price ranges is explored.

#### Task 2: Price Range Analysis

**Objective:**  
Examine how price range affects restaurant ratings.

**Tasks:**
- Determine the most common price range among all the restaurants.
- Calculate the average rating for each price range.
- Identify the price range that represents the highest average rating.

**Description:**  
The analysis aims to understand how different price ranges correlate with restaurant ratings. The most common price range is identified, and the average rating for each range is calculated. The price range with the highest average rating is highlighted, providing insights into the perceived value by customers.

#### Task 3: Feature Engineering

**Objective:**  
Enhance the dataset by creating additional features.

**Tasks:**
- Extract additional features from the existing columns, such as the length of the restaurant name or address.
- Create new features like "Has Table Booking" or "Has Online Delivery" by encoding categorical variables.

**Description:**  
Feature engineering is performed to enrich the dataset with new variables. Additional features are extracted from existing columns, and new categorical features are created. These engineered features are intended to improve the performance of predictive models and provide deeper insights.

### Level 3

#### Task 1: Predictive Modeling

**Objective:**  
Build and evaluate a regression model to predict restaurant ratings.

**Tasks:**
- Build a regression model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on available features.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets and evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- Experiment with different algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forest) and compare their performance.

**Description:**  
A regression model is developed to predict restaurant ratings. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as RMSE or MAE. Different algorithms are tested to identify the best-performing model.

#### Task 2: Customer Preference Analysis

**Objective:**  
Analyze customer preferences based on cuisine types and ratings.

**Tasks:**
- Analyze the relationship between the type of cuisine and the restaurant's rating.
- Identify the most popular cuisines among customers based on the number of votes.
- Determine if there are any specific cuisines that tend to receive higher ratings.

**Description:**  
Customer preferences are analyzed by examining the relationship between cuisine types and ratings. The most popular cuisines are identified based on customer votes, and cuisines that receive higher ratings are highlighted, providing insights into customer preferences.

---

#### Task 3: Data Visualization

**Objective:**  
Create visualizations to represent various insights from the data.

**Tasks:**
- Create visualizations to represent the distribution of ratings using different charts (histogram, bar plot, etc.).
- Compare the average ratings of different cuisines or cities using appropriate visualizations.
- Visualize the relationship between various features and the target variable to gain insights.

**Description:**  
Data visualization techniques are used to represent key insights from the dataset. Various charts are created to show the distribution of ratings, compare average ratings of different cuisines or cities, and visualize relationships between features and the target variable. These visualizations help in understanding patterns and trends in the data.
